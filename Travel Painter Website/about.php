          <td ><p> Abdul Rahman was born in Penang (Malaysia) in 1944 and  started painting when he was in secondary school with art being one of his favourite subjects.

          <p>A former diplomat,  Abdul Rahman, retired from the Malaysian Foreign Service in 1997 having lived abroad  for more than 30 years. A widely-travelled person, he was Ambassador to several European, African and Middle Eastern countries and also the Malaysian Permanent Representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia-Pacific region - UN (ESCAP). His travels abroad had also enriched him with the exposure to many of the main museums, galleries,  artists and art organisations around the world. He painted what he loved most of the local scenic places in his travels as part of a balanced life-style between work and relaxation. He is also an art collector with a penchant for Islamic and Orientalist works.</p></td>

          <p>Better known as a landscape-artist, he paints only for the sake of enjoyment and recording  nature's beauty and man's relationship towards his environment. His painting in oil,  incorporates a profusion of the local colours which culminate in his belief that one must harmonize with the environment and respect it.  In 2000, he ventured into developing vacation homes for the expatriate community in Langkawi islands, beside setting up his  residence-studio (Manora Gallery) showcasing his collections of art works and paintings on the island.  He has participated in several group exhibitions in Malaysia and abroad. He now spent his time between Kuala Lumpur and Langkawi, and continues to paint the landscapes scenes which he enjoys most during his travels at home and abroad.   “The joy of painting is when you do it for nothing else than your own satisfaction and to capture something you personally see as inspiring, beautiful and God's creation”</p> </td>

          <p> Several of his works have appeared in greeting cards, limited edition prints, magazines and e-print media. While keeping a low-profile in his art endeavours, his series on Langkawi and Malaysian landscapes scenes have gained acceptance among private individuals and corporate collectors. In 1997, his entry “The Datai-Langkawi” won an award for a nation-wide art competion organized  by the Ministry of Culture, Art and Tourism and the National Art Gallery.</p></td>
