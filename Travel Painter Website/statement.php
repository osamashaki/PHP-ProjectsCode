        <p style="background: transparent url(images/transparent.png) repeat; padding:15px"> Painting for me is personal. Any chance discovery of a picturesque place where the split second exposure of light, colour, and awe are captured in revealing beauty, is a creative challenge to record it on canvas to last a life time. I love landscapes and inorder to paint the subject well, one must have a deep respect for the land and the people who live in it. I like that connection and hope to bring a further awareness and appreciation of the world around us.  </p>

<p style="background: transparent url(images/transparent.png) repeat; padding:15px">The landscape of today are under pressure and constantly changing. Existing ones are destroyed and   replaced by new development, more so in the city where change occurs on a fast, human timetable rather than on a slow geological one. My primary form of art is contemporary impressionism and as a travel-painter, I search widely (at home and abroad) to find inspiration from the countryside and urban scenes to record what I see and experience in Mother Nature. The use of Nature and Art has been in place since the beginning of time when cave paintings were produced and the life and the surroundings of the people were recorded.  Simply put, I paint what I see and hope other people will be connected to enjoy it, too.</p>
